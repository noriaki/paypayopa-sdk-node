We recommend that the merchant implements a Polling of the Get payment Details API with a 4-5 second interval in order to know the status of the transaction.

## Lets get Started
Once you have understood the payment flow, before we start the integration make sure you have:

- [Registered](https://developer.paypay.ne.jp/) for a PayPay developer/merchant Account
- Get the API key and secret from the Developer Panel.
- Use the sandbox API Keys to test out the integration

### Install npm package
```sh
$ npm install @paypayopa/paypayopa-sdk-node
```
